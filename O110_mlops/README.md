### What is MLOps?
- A set of principles and practices to standardize and streamline the machine learning lifecycle management.
- Integration between development and operational processes.
- Teams collaborate to build, automate, test, and monitor the machine learning pipelines.
- Based upon the DevOps principles of Continuous. Integration, Continuous delivery + Continuous training

### What is EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)?
- EDA is a crucial initial step in the data analysis process, especially in machine learning. 
- EDA involves examining and understanding the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
