# Find First Unique Number
  A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The unique number is the number that occurs exactly once in array A
For example, the following array A:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 10
    A[2] = 5
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 2
    A[5] = 10
contains two unique numbers (5 and 2).
You should find the first unique number in A. In other words, find the unique number with the lowest position in A
For above example, 5 is in second position (because A[2] = 5) and 2 is in fourth position (because A[4] = 2). So, the first unique number is 5.

Write a function:
```java
class Solution {
    public static int solution(int[] n) {
        
    }
}
```

that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the first unique number in A. The function should return -1 if there are no unique numbers in A.
For example, given:

    A[0] = 1
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 2
