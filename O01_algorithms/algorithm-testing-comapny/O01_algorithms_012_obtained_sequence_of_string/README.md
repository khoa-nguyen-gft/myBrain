  # Obtained sequence of string
  Initially, string S of length N is given. Then N-1 operations are applied to it: move the first letter of S to the end. How many times is the first letter of S the same as the last letter?
For example, given S = "abbaa", the obtained sequence of string
iS:

  Three of them have the same first and last letter.
  Write a function:
```java
   public static int solution(String s) {
    
}
```
  that, given a string S of length N, consisting of letters 'a' and/or
  'b', returns the number of times the first letter is the same as th last in the obtained sequence of strings.
