# Maximum possible value obtainable

Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns the maximum possible value obtainable by deleting one '5 digit from the decimal representation of N. 
It is guaranteed that N will contain at least one '5* digit.

**Examples:**
1. Given N = 15958, the function should return 1958.
2. Given N = -5859, the function should return -589.
3. Given N = -5000, the function should return 0. After deleting the '5', the only digits in the number are
   zeroes, so its value is 0.

- Assume that:
   - N is an integer within the range (-999,995..999,995];
   - N contains at least one '5' digit in its decimal representation;
   - N consists of at least two digits in its decimal representation.
   
- In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
